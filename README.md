# SchoolMS #

SchoolMS (School Management System) is a web application dedicated to manage administrative aspects of educational institutions.

## Main features ##

* User authentication
* Students management into levels and branches
* Subjects and teachers management
* Viewing and editing weekly schedule for all classes.

## Technical considerations ##

* This is a single page application (SPA), this means greate user experience and efficient use of bandwidth.
* The front-end uses re-usable Reactjs components that can add extra functionality for free.
* It uses a No-sql document database (MongoDB), this means no strict schema.  New fields and resources can be added on the go.
* The back-end is a Restfull API built on Node.js, this means other front-ends can benifit from the same codebase, such as mobile applications.
